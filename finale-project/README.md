# FINALE_PROJECT_BIG_DATA



## Overview
This project, conducted as part of  Big Data Analytics, focuses on selecting a problem amenable to Big Data techniques. The goal is to investigate, implement a solution, and analyze the resulting system based on relevant performance metrics. The project areas include MapReduce, Spark, SparkML, and tools for big data education.

## Project Topics
1. **MapReduce Exploration:**
   - Compare distributed processing with traditional serial methods on a specific task.
   - Improve a traditional serial problem by implementing a MapReduce program.
   - Utilize datasets from resources like Kaggle or Google Public Datasets.

2. **Spark and SparkML:**
   - Choose a dataset and explore Spark or SparkML for tasks such as classification, regression, or detection.

3. **Tools for Big Data Education:**
   - Investigate alternatives to creating Hadoop environments with Docker containers for educational purposes.
   - Explore tools or platforms like Google or Amazon for educational applications.

4. **Other AI Problems:**
   - Propose and explore AI problems beyond the specified topics.

## Collaboration
This project is a collaborative effort between two students enrolled in Big Data. Each student will provide a 1-page statement detailing their contributions and key lessons learned.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in applying Big Data analytics techniques to real-world problems. The collaborative effort will enhance learning outcomes and foster a deeper understanding of the concepts covered in subject.
